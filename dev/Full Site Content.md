## 👤 ABOUT PAGE

### Section: Introduction

I’m **Nicky Bruno**, a Montreal-based developer, designer, and automation consultant. I’ve spent over two decades helping Canadian businesses and startups create digital systems that actually make life easier.

Visual: photo \+ signature overlay.

---

### Section: My Story

Short narrative:

I started designing websites in the early 2000s, long before “responsive” was a buzzword. Over the years I moved from pure design into full-stack development, automation, and AI — always chasing one goal: **simplify complexity**. Today, I combine that experience to help others build tools that save time and look great doing it.

Visual: horizontal timeline animation with decade markers.

### Section: Values & Approach

| Value | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Clarity first** | Tech explained in plain language. |
| **Human design** | Tools should feel natural. |
| **Reliability** | I finish what I start. |
| **Transparency** | No hidden costs or jargon. |

Illustration: four icons sliding in sequence.

### Section: “Behind the Screen”

Personal touch:

When I’m not building digital systems, I’m sketching design ideas, experimenting with lighting tech for Lumicerra, or playing outside with my daughter Eva.
