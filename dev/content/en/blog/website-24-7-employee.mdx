# Your Website Is Your 24/7 Employee

A good website does real work for you:

- **Reception:** answers FAQs, routes messages, books meetings.  
- **Sales:** shows proof (case studies, testimonials, results).  
- **Support:** provides guides, forms, and a simple contact path.

**Checklist**  
- Loads in under 2s on mobile  
- Clear “what you do” in the hero  
- Obvious CTA (two max)  
- SEO basics + analytics  
- Easy to edit without calling a developer

Build it once, let it work every day.
