# 5 Simple Automations That Save You an Hour a Day

You don’t need AI to save time (though it can help). Start with these:

1. **Email → Spreadsheet log**  
   Auto‑append new leads to a Google Sheet. Instant CRM.

2. **Form submissions → Slack ping**  
   Get notified when a quote request arrives — respond faster.

3. **Calendar → Daily brief**  
   Every morning, get a summary of your meetings + links.

4. **File rename & sort**  
   Standardize filenames and drop them into the right folders.

5. **Invoice reminders**  
   Gentle follow‑ups 7/14/30 days after an unpaid invoice.

*Tools:* n8n / Zapier, Google Workspace, Notion/Sheets, Slack.  
*Tip:* Build one small flow, then add steps as you see what’s working.
