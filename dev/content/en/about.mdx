# I turn complexity into simple, human tools.

I’m **Nicky Bruno**, a Montreal‑based developer, designer, and automation consultant. I’ve spent over two decades helping Canadian businesses and startups create digital systems that actually make life easier.

## My Story

I started designing websites in the early 2000s, then moved into full‑stack development, automation, and AI — always chasing one goal: **simplify complexity**.

Today, I combine design, code, and strategy to build solutions that are practical, modern, and ready for growth.

## Values & Approach

- **Clarity first.** Tech explained in plain language.  
- **Human design.** Tools should feel natural and invisible.  
- **Reliability.** I finish what I start.  
- **Transparency.** No jargon, no hidden costs.

## Behind the Screen

When I’m not building digital systems, I’m sketching UI ideas, experimenting with lighting tech for **Lumicerra**, or playing outside with my daughter **Eva**.
