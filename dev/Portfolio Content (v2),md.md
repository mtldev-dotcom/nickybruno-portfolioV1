## **About**

Hi, I’m **Nicky Bruno** — a developer, designer, and creative problem solver based in Montreal.  
 I’ve spent over two decades helping business owners, entrepreneurs, and creative teams bring ideas to life through **websites, automation, design, and digital strategy**.

Think of me as your **go-to guy** when it comes to making technology actually *work for you*, not against you.

### **🧩 What I Do**

I connect the dots between technology, creativity, and efficiency:

* Build beautiful, easy-to-use **websites** that attract and convert customers

* Set up **automations** that handle repetitive tasks so you can focus on growth

* Create clear, modern **branding and design systems** that stand out

* Develop **digital products** — from dashboards to e-commerce stores

* Offer **training and guidance** so you and your team can stay confident using new tools

### **💡 Everyday Examples**

* **Website Example:**  
   You own a renovation company and want clients to request quotes online. I’ll design a site that looks professional, loads fast, and automatically sends inquiries to your email or CRM — no copy-pasting needed.

* **Automation Example (Non-AI):**  
   You get customer messages from your website, Facebook, and email. Instead of checking all three, I can connect them into one dashboard so you never miss a message again.

* **AI Automation Example:**  
   You receive dozens of customer questions daily — most are similar. I can set up a smart virtual assistant that answers FAQs instantly and sends you only the complex requests.

* **Design & Branding Example:**  
   You’re launching a new product and want your brand to feel unified — from logo to packaging to social posts. I’ll design a consistent look that communicates your values and quality.

* **Learning Example:**  
   You’ve invested in digital tools but don’t know how to use them efficiently. I’ll show you step by step how to make the most of them — without jargon or confusion.

### **🎯 My Approach**

I believe that:

* Technology should *simplify* your day, not complicate it.

* Good design builds *trust* before a single word is spoken.

* Every project should create *real results* — not just pretty visuals.

That’s why I combine design, code, and strategy to build solutions that are practical, modern, and built for growth.
