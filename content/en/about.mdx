## A builder who bridges strategy and delivery

I split my time between product discovery, interaction design, and implementation. That blend lets me stay close to the problem space while still sweating the details of a production codebase. It also means I can move from whiteboard to shipped feature without translating ideas through multiple teams.

## Principles I bring to every engagement

- **Story first.** Great products communicate clearly. I design every flow to highlight the value before the feature.
- **Bilingual by default.** Montreal living made me care deeply about inclusive, multilingual experiences.
- **Instrumentation matters.** From performance budgets to observability, measurement guides iteration.
- **Automation with humans in mind.** AI should unlock focus, not create more chaos. I design with operators in the loop.

## Outside the editor

When I’m not prototyping, you can find me recording modular synth sessions, cycling along the Lachine Canal, or volunteering with organizations that mentor first-time founders.
